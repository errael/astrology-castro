These scripts extract data structures from Astrolog source.

This only needs to be done once when there's a new Astrolog release.
Could put a check in the build that detects a difference.

EXTRACT FUNCTIONS
    Extract the functions, look at the script. When it's run
    it outputs the target location

        ./extract_functions > xxx
        diff xxx <target>   # see what changed
        cp xxx <target>

EXTRACT CONSTANT STRINGS
    extract_constants - using awk, pull out the specified arrays
    clean_table_pairs - change '{"xxx", id}' to '"xxx" /*id*/'
                        edit into java array definition.

        ./extract_constants | clean_table_pairs > xxx
        diff xxx <target>   # see what changed
        cp xxx <target>
